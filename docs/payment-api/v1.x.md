# NETOPIA Payments API - Version 1.x

## Overview

:::warning [This API Version Will Be Phased Out]
[Version 2.x](/docs/payment-api/v2.x/introduction) is the latest release of the NETOPIA Payments API and is recommended for both new and existing customers. This version uses JSON endpoints and is secured with API tokens. Version 1.x will be fully phased out by the end of 2025. This documentation is provided to assist existing customers until they complete their migration.
:::

## Introduction

The NETOPIA Payments API provides a flexible and secure way to integrate payments into your applications. This guide covers the API structure, authentication, security measures, and request/response formats.

## Architecture

### Client-Server Model

NETOPIA API follows a **client-server** model:
- The client (your website or application) sends a request using **POST** to one of NETOPIA's service endpoints.
- The user is redirected to NETOPIA’s payment page.
- NETOPIA processes the payment and notifies your server.

## Security Measures

To ensure secure transactions, the API implements:
1. **Request authentication** via API Signature (Signature field).
2. **Data encryption** using RSA keys.
3. **Secure transport** via SSL/TLS (recommended for responses).

## Payment Request Workflow

**Process Overview:**
1. Redirect the user to NETOPIA with a payment request.
2. NETOPIA processes the transaction and notifies your server.
3. Your system handles the IPN (Instant Payment Notification).

**Key Parameters:**
- `env_key` – Public key for encryption.
- `data` – XML-structured payment details, signed with NETOPIA’s public certificate.
- `cipher` – Encryption algorithm.
- `iv` – Initialization vector for encryption security.

## Service Endpoints

| Payment Mode | Standard Payment | One-Click Payment |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Live** | [https://secure.mobilpay.ro](https://secure.mobilpay.ro) | [https://secure.mobilpay.ro/card4](https://secure.mobilpay.ro/card4) |
| **Test** | [https://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro](https://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro) | [https://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro/card4](http://sandboxsecure.mobilpay.ro/card4) |

For language-specific interfaces, append the language code (e.g., `/en` for English).

## Payment Response Structure

Upon every change in the status of a payment, NETOPIA will make a `POST` request to the URL set as the confirmation endpoint, with the `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The request will contain the following parameters: `env_key`, `data`, `cipher`, and optionally, `iv`. The response XML will be encrypted using an X509 public certificate, and you must decrypt it using the private key provided by NETOPIA (or your own).

You will receive all the parameters you initially sent, unchanged, along with an additional element, called **mobilpay**, in the response XML.

### XML Format
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<order type="card" id="ORDER_ID" timestamp="YYYYMMDDHHMMSS">
    <mobilpay timestamp="YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" crc="XXXXX">

### Merchant's Response

For each call to your confirmation URL, you must send a response in XML format back to NETOPIA, indicating whether you have successfully recorded the response. This response is crucial for NETOPIA to determine whether to retry sending the IPN.

If you encounter an error, you should specify an error code and message. You can check your response in the [NETOPIA Platform](https://admin.netopia-payments.com/) under `Orders > Card`, selecting `Any` status and identifying the transaction.

#### XML Response Format
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<crc error_type="1|2" error_code="numeric">message</crc>
```

---

### Response Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Format / Constraints | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **`error_type`** | Determines if NETOPIA will retry sending the IPN. | `1` (Temporary Error), `2` (Permanent Error) | Set to `1` for temporary issues, `2` for permanent failures. |
| **`error_code`** | Your internal error code. | Numeric | Helps diagnose issues on your system. |
| **`message`** | Your error message. | String | If no error, return the received `crc` value or an appropriate success message. |

This structured response ensures smooth communication with NETOPIA and prevents unnecessary retries of failed IPNs.
