# Points of Sale

:::tip[Points of sale]
A point of sale is a web app or an online shop - on the tech side we support many programming languages (PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript) and a wide range of ecommerce platforms (WordPress, Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop).
:::

### Setting up a Point of Sale

To set up a fully operational point of sale, follow these three steps:

#### 1. Create the Point of Sale
Define the details such as the name, URL, and platform. Obtain the point of sale signature and encryption keys, which are essential for the technical implementation.

#### 2. Integrate the Payment Feature on Your E-commerce Platform
Use the provided documentation tailored to your chosen e-commerce platform. For custom web apps, you can integrate the payment feature using our SDKs.

#### 3. Request Validation of the Technical Implementation
Once the integration is complete, email implementare@netopia.ro to request final validation. Our technical support team will activate your point of sale, enabling you to start receiving payments.

Let's detail those steps one by one:

### Step 1 - Create the point of sale

In Netopia Payments admin dashboard [https://admin.netopia-payments.com/](https://admin.netopia-payments.com/), go to **Points of sale** / **Puncte de vânzare** in the left menu, then click on the **Add** / **Adaugă** button from the top right

![Step one](../../static/img/wordpress/wordpress-plugin-1.png)

Select your e-commerce platform. The first option is suitable for web apps or typical e-commerce platforms (Wordpress, Prestashop, Magento, Opencart).

Next, you can find all the major ecommerce platforms and SDKs (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.)

### Step 2 - Implement the payment feature on the ecommerce platform

The next step is to begin the implementation of the payment feature into your e-commerce platform. You will use our sandbox environment for all the tests.

If you already use a shopping cart platform, choose the appropriate documentation page from the following:
- [Wordpress](/docs/payment-plugins/wordpress)
- [Prestashop](/docs/payment-plugins/prestashop)
- [Magento](/docs/payment-plugins/magento)
- [Opencart](/docs/payment-plugins/opencart)

If you don't use a shopping cart platform, and you develop you custom online store, head over to the [Payment SDKs](/docs/payment-sdks) page, or directly to the documentation page related to your web framework:
- [PHP](/docs/payment-sdks/php)
- [Node JS](/docs/payment-sdks/nodejs)
- [Python](/docs/payment-sdks/python)
- [Ruby](/docs/payment-sdks/ruby)
- [Java](/docs/payment-sdks/java)

If none of those apply to your online store, please [contact us](mailto:implementare@netopia.ro) and we'll redirect you to an appropriate documentation.

### Step 3 - Request the validation for the technical implementation

For your final validation of the Point of Sale, the following checklist needs to be filled in:

- You must meet the listed mandatory conditions
- Add the Netopia logos on the website
- Comply with ANPC regulations regarding consumer information on alternative dispute resolution
- Upload the loan agreement, invoice, or any other official document proving that the website domain is owned by your company

- Clear and complete description of goods and services
- Clear display of prices and the transaction currency
- Complete contact details of the company (name, VAT number, address, phone, email)
- The business activity is not part of a high-risk category
- Terms and conditions
- Privacy policy
- Order delivery policy
- Order cancellation policy
- GDPR policy (personal data protection)
- Security certificate (SSL)

Our [technical support team](mailto:implementare@netopia.ro) will help you identify and solve any technical issues that may be blocking your validation.

After the technical implementation is successful, our team will activate your point of sale, enabling you to start receiving payments.
