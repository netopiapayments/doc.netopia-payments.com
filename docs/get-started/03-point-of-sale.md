# Points of Sale

:::tip[Points of sale]
A point of sale is a web app or an online shop - on the tech side we support many programming languages (PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript) and a wide range of ecommerce platforms (WordPress, Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop).
:::

## Setting up

To set up a fully operational point of sale, follow these three steps:

### Step 1 - Create the Point of Sale
Create a new Point of Sale in the [Netopia Admin Dashboard](https://admin.netopia-payments.com). Define the details such as name, URL, and platform. Once created, you can obtain the signature and encryption keys, which are essential for the technical implementation.

### Step 2 - Integrate the Netopia payment solution

Use the provided documentation tailored to your chosen e-commerce platform. For custom web apps, you can integrate the payment solution using our SDKs.

### Step 3 - Request validation of the technical implementation

Once the integration is complete, email implementare@netopia.ro to request the final validation. Our technical support team will activate your Point of Sale, enabling you to start receiving payments.

### Step 2 - Implement the Netopia payment solution

The next step is to begin the implementation of the payment solution into your e-commerce platform. You can use our sandbox environment for all the tests.

You can find the specific documentation for all the supported platforms below:
- [Wordpress](/docs/payment-plugins/wordpress)
- [Prestashop](/docs/payment-plugins/prestashop)
- [Magento](/docs/payment-plugins/magento)
- [Opencart](/docs/payment-plugins/opencart)

If you aren't using any of the platforms above and are developing your own custom online store, head over to the [Payment SDKs](/docs/payment-sdks) page, or directly to the documentation page related to the language you are using:
- [PHP](/docs/payment-sdks/php)
- [Node JS](/docs/payment-sdks/nodejs)
- [Python](/docs/payment-sdks/python)
- [Ruby](/docs/payment-sdks/ruby)
- [Java](/docs/payment-sdks/java)

If none of those apply to your online store, please [contact us](mailto:implementare@netopia.ro) and we'll redirect you to an appropriate documentation.

### Step 3 - Request validation of the technical implementation

For your final Point of Sale validation, the following checklist needs to be completed:

- You must meet the listed mandatory conditions
- Add the Netopia logos on the website
- Comply with ANPC regulations regarding consumer information on alternative dispute resolution
- Upload the loan agreement, invoice, or any other official document proving that the website domain is owned by your company

- Clear and complete description of goods and services
- Clear display of prices and the transaction currency
- Complete contact details of the company (name, VAT number, address, phone, email)
- The business activity is not part of a high-risk category
- Terms and conditions
- Privacy policy
- Order delivery policy
- Order cancellation policy
- GDPR policy (personal data protection)
- Security certificate (SSL)

In case there is something wrong with the validation process, our [technical support team](mailto:implementare@netopia.ro) will help you identify and solve any technical issues that may be blocking your validation.

After completing all the items in the checklist above and the technical implementation is successful, our team will activate your Point of Sale, enabling you to start receiving payments.
