You can use the Sandbox environment to test all your integrations and configurations.

Until your final validation you will be required to **use only the Sandbox Keys**.

To access the Sandbox environment, simply click on the "Mediu de testare / Testing environment" button in the left menu of the Netopia Admin dashboard.
