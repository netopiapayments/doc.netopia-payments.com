title: Technical Implementation

Begin the technical implementation of the payment feature into your e-commerce platform. You will use our sandbox environment for all the tests.

If you already use a shopping cart platform, choose the appropriate documentation page from the following:
- [Wordpress](/docs/payment-plugins/wordpress)
- [Prestashop](/docs/payment-plugins/prestashop)
- [Magento](/docs/payment-plugins/magento)
- [Opencart](/docs/payment-plugins/opencart)

If you don't use a shopping cart platform, and you develop you custom online store, head over to the [Payment SDKs](/docs/payment-sdks) page, or directly to the documentation page related to your web framework:
- [PHP](/docs/payment-sdks/php)
- [Node JS](/docs/payment-sdks/nodejs)
- [Python](/docs/payment-sdks/python)
- [Ruby](/docs/payment-sdks/ruby)
- [Java](/docs/payment-sdks/java)

If none of those apply to your online store, please [contact us](mailto:implementare@netopia.ro) and we'll redirect you to an appropriate documentation.
