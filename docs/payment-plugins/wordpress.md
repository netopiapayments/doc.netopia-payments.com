## Setting up

#### 1. You need a Point of Sale before you can configure a payment gateway. If you don't have one yet, please first follow the [Points of Sale](/docs/get-started/03-point-of-sale.md) instructions and return here once you have a validated Point of Sale.

#### 2. In the WordPress dashboard, go to the "Plugins" page in the left menu and search for "netopia" in the search box.
Then, click on the "Install Now" button for the NETOPIA Payments WooCommerce Payment Gateway plugin.

#### 4. To continue setting up the payment through the Netopia Payments plugin, go to WooCommerce in the left menu, navigate to "Settings," and then to the "Payments" tab.
Here, you need to check NETOPIA Payments under the "Enabled" column and click the "Manage" button to continue configuring the plugin.
